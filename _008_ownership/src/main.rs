fn main() {
    // rule of ownership
    // 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
    // 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    // 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    let s1 = String::from("Bayern Munich");
    let s2 = s1;

    /*
    println!("s1: {}", s1); // error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`

    Now, s1 is no longer vaild. because s1's internal pointer is copied to s2 and s1 is dropped.

    Jayden:
        This is similar to C++'s move semantics. 
        I surprised that the default = operator is c++ move constructor in Rust. ðŸ˜‚
